Introduction
============

The aim of this document is to describe a general procedure for the calibration of Metatron HDS.
In particular the purpose of the following pages is to explain the basic characteristics of the engine control strategies and to show in details the sequence of actions to perform HDS ECU calibration on engine/vehicle using toolset and SW operating under Windows |copy|

Chapter division follows the natural succession of actions that people have to do during engine calibration; the SW naming too follows this approach.

The present calibration manual is divided into main sections and annexes. Every section represents the step to be completed before next one in order to achieve the final calibration dataset.

*	Section I provides general information on HDS, suggested instrumentation and fitting of HDS ECU and other Metatron components, general information on used toolset and SW,

*	Section II provides detailed information to perform ECU base calibration on engine dyno.

*	Section III provides all information/suggestion needed to achieve engineering targets such performances and emission

*	Annexes section provides all useful information needed/recommended before and during HDS mounting on dyno (such as schematics for dyno bench configuration, component specifications and diagnostic code) for calibration engineers. Also, it contains side information useful during entire process of calibration.
